### Mask Generation Workflow
1. **Draw Outline**: Create a closed loop around your subject
2. **Automatic Detection**: Node automatically detects enclosed area
3. **Mask Output**: Use the mask for selective editing
4. **Apply Effects**: Use mask with other nodes for targeted effects

## Advanced Techniques

### Creating Perfect Masks
1. **Continuous Lines**: Ensure your outline forms a complete loop
2. **Zoom Control**: Use browser zoom for precision on detailed areas
3. **Multiple Passes**: Draw rough outline first, then refine with undo/redo
4. **Quality Check**: Execute node to verify mask quality before proceeding

### High-Resolution Editing
- **Full Resolution**: Canvas maintains original image resolution
- **Display Scaling**: Large images are scaled for comfortable editing
- **Quality Preservation**: No quality loss during editing process
- **Precision Drawing**: Mouse coordinates mapped accurately to full resolution

### Workflow Integration
- **Non-Destructive**: Original image is never modified
- **Session Persistence**: Edits are saved until node is reset
- **Batch Compatible**: Can be used in batch processing workflows
- **Memory Efficient**: Only stores drawing data, not full images

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: Node doesn't appear in ComfyUI
- **Solution**: 
  1. Verify files are in correct location
  2. Restart ComfyUI completely
  3. Check console for error messages

- **Solution**:
  1. Click "Save & Close" before executing node
  2. Verify node execution completed
  3. Check if image was modified in editor

**Issue**: Mask output is empty
